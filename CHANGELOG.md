# Changelog

## Unreleased — Publication consistency

- Align Arduino's NimBLE dependency range with PlatformIO (`>=2.5.0 && <3.0.0`).
- Distinguish CI-built targets from experimental, unverified chips; retain all
  code paths without promising on-air verification or certification.
- Explain immutable release tags and commit-pinned snapshots. Keep FindMyAdv
  version 1.1.0 and its implementation/API unchanged.

## Unreleased — Lifecycle regression

- Drain the previous scheduler before restarting with `begin()` after `end()`.
  Previously an immediate restart could reset the stop request and leave two
  scheduler tasks active. The same bounded shutdown path serves `reconfigure()`.
- Add host-side regression tests compiling the real implementation against fake
  FreeRTOS/BLE calls, covering repeated restart and switching to manual polling.
- No API, package version, radio payload, key or existing release-tag changes.

All notable changes to FindMyAdv are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Increased the default provider window from 5 to 6 seconds.
- Provider windows are now clamped to at least three stationary advertising
  intervals, with an absolute minimum of one second.

### Fixed

- Bluedroid no longer advances or overwrites a provider while its asynchronous
  stop/configure/start sequence is still pending.
- Bluedroid provider timing now starts after the controller confirms that the
  new payload is actually advertising, rather than when configuration begins.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Replaced the default Bluedroid path with a single NimBLE-Arduino dependency
  on all tested ESP32 targets.
- Uses direct GAP advertising with fixed buffers instead of high-level BLE
  advertising containers.
- Added documented broadcaster-only flags that remove unused client, scanner,
  GATT-server, connection, and logging features.
- Reduced the optional scheduler task default from 4096 to 3072 bytes and made
  it configurable with `schedulerTaskStackBytes`.
- Made the built-in ST accelerometer driver compile-time removable without
  disabling custom motion callbacks.

### Fixed

- `begin()` now reports a first-advertisement failure instead of returning a
  false-positive running state on NimBLE.
- Rejects overlong and incorrectly padded advertisement keys instead of
  silently accepting a truncated value.
- Removed the unconditional `Wire.h` include from the public API header.
- Added CI builds for normal, broadcaster-only, absolute-minimum, and legacy
  Bluedroid configurations.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Apple Find My and Google Find Hub legacy advertising.
- Automatic Apple/Google provider rotation.
- ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP32-S3 Bluedroid backend.
- ESP32-C6/ESP32-H2 NimBLE backend.
- Background FreeRTOS scheduler with optional manual polling.
- Runtime `setKeys()` and complete `reconfigure()` APIs.
- Optional LIS3DH/LIS2DH/LIS2DH12 dynamic advertising rate.
- Pluggable motion callback for any other sensor or application state.
- English and Italian documentation and three integration examples.
